"Feast Hub" is a website I built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I used Visual Studio Code and Xampp for development. The main goal of this project is to show how to connect the information people enter on a form to a database. It's like a behind-the-scenes look at how websites handle data. The website is user-friendly, and it's a practical example of connecting the front-end (what users see) with the back-end (where data is stored) seamlessly.
